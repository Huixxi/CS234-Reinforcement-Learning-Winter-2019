# Assignment 1
This assignment is a easy one, corresponding to lecture 1 and lecture 2, which runs under the modified simulate environment of [Open AI gym toy_text frozen_lake](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/frozen_lake.py). You better learn the course slides scrupulously and do the written homework first, which guarantees you fully understand the algorithm.  
***Notes:*** I have modified some codes of the original version assignment mainly because I thought these codes were wrong. I have annotated for these modified parts.
